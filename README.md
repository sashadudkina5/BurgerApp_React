# React Project: BurgerApp

This project is a dynamic web application built with Create React App. It's a burger builder application where users can customize their burger with various ingredients, place orders, and review past orders.

## Deployed Site

The application is deployed and can be accessed at [BurgerApp Live Site](https://sashadudkina5.github.io/BurgerApp_React/).

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**
- **Redux**
- **React Router**
- **TypeScript**
- **Jest**
- **Cypress**
- **WebSocket**

## Future Plans

In addition to the existing features, here are some future plans for enhancing the BurgerApp:

- **Responsive Design for Mobile Screens**

- **Enhanced Form Input Styles and Functionalities**

## Documentation

The project is documented with JSDoc. 
This includes:

- Documentation for all React components, providing insights into the props and states used.
- Documentation for all thunk functions to understand the asynchronous operations and redux state management.
- Descriptions for supplementary functions.

This effort aims to make the codebase more accessible and to facilitate easier updates and feature additions.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the application to GitHub Pages. Requires the `gh-pages` package and a `predeploy` script to build the application before deployment.
